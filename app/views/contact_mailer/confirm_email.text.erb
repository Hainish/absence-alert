Hello,

Someone with the email address `<%= @user_email %>` has requested that you be added to their contact list on Absence Alert. Being a contact for `<%= @user_email %>` means that you may be notified via email if something unexpected happens and this user becomes unreachable. It's like being an emergency contact for this person.

To confirm, click on this link:
<%= confirm_contact_url id: @id, confirmation_token: @confirmation_token %>

If you do not wish to be a contact, you can ignore this message or click on this link:
<%= reject_contact_url id: @id, confirmation_token: @confirmation_token %>


Thank you,
Action Alert
